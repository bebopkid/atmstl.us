# atmstl.us

Art Tech Meetup STL (#ATMSTL) is a casual monthly meetup for artists, technologists, and those in between to discuss new projects, find work, get feedback, and meet other creative technologists. #ATMSTL is helping formalize the existing community of artists working with tech, across various disciplines, and establishing a foundation for co-operations, exchanges and networking. 

At past meetups, artists have shared works in progress, demoed new work, lectured, or shared their process. Past presenters have included: Eric Donte, Evan T Smith/Stacey Smith, Paal Williams/Marissa Dembkoski of PWMD, Hayden Molinarolo, Aaron Owens, Marina Peng, Tj Hughes, PixelPop, and others.

Currently, #ATMSTL takes place in the Cortex district at Venture Café St. Louis' Thursday Gathering, which provides free space and free beer and wine.

#ATMSTL is from 6–8pm with talks and demos starting at 6:30pm and ending at 7:30pm. Artists talks/demos are anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.
